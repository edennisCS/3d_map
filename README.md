# 3D Planets in Stonehenge - Google Maps 3D

Planets are aligned over the iconic Stonehenge site which has historical associations with planetary alignment. Using the Google Maps 3D JavaScript API, this project blends astronomy and geography, creating an engaging experience for users to explore celestial bodies in a Stonehenge. It flies you through then you can explore around yourself. Showcasing the potential of 3D Maps for immersive storytelling to promote places and curiousity.

## Historical Significance

Stonehenge, located in Wiltshire, England, has long been a subject of interest for both archaeologists and astronomers. Many believe it was constructed as a tool for tracking astronomical events, such as the solstices, equinoxes, and lunar cycles. The alignment of the stones at Stonehenge with the solstitial sunrise and sunset, as well as the positioning of certain stones relative to the stars, suggests that the site was used for observing celestial events.
## Spark Curiosity 

This project invites users on a journey of discovery, prompting questions about the solar system and the ways in which ancient cultures engaged with the cosmos. To spark curiousity in Space and historical culture. 
## Usage

Please provide your own Google Maps 3D API key within the box labelled <key>, and you will need a Google Cloud account. 
Then run the code locally using Live server on VScode.


## Lessons Learned/Challenges overcome

It was difficult to get the 3D models to where I wanted, I decided on using google maps as a coordinate reference which worked well, then shifted the coordinates in small amounts. 

There were challenges with the flyover optimising the heights and start and end position, took time to figure out where to start and adjustment. 

There was a need to keep the project visually not too overwhelming so you could keep your focus on the planets. 



## Features

Flythrough Animation: A dynamic camera animation takes users through the planetary alignment alongside Stonehenge.
3D Models: Planets are represented using .glb 3D models, scaled and ordered.
Custom Marker: Each planet has a label and marker for easy identification.


## Technologies Used

Google Maps JavaScript 3D API 
3D Models: .glb format for planets.
